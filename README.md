# eleWP8

This is an app for ordering meals from **ele.me** on **windows phone 8**, because there's no app for WP.
It uses API from m.ele.me which is the mobile version of ele.me. This mobile version has bug when showing menus and quiet slow for 2G network. To solve these problems, this project is created. 

I hope this can help stuffs of ele.me to pay atttension on WP users.

## Functions
* Search locations
* Show restaurants around the given location
* Log in and show history orders
* Jump to IE for further operations, e.g. show menu, add to cart, submit order, pay online.
